## Extra Exercises:

## System Programming:
Extra:
- Start with going over lecture notes for [Prof. Anton's System Programming Course](https://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/edu/sysprog21f/) ‚ö†Ô∏è
    - Status: Not Started
- May skip the below for now in favour of getting SoE 3SH3 out of the way first
- Work on the exercises ‚ö†Ô∏è [Prof. Anton's System Programming Course](https://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/edu/sysprog21f/)
    - Status: Not Started - Skipping, most likely will do some of the questions
- Do the Rutgers's Programming Assignments: ‚ö†Ô∏è
    - Status: Not Started - Skipping, may come back

## Operating Systems
Section yet to be complete (will add additional resources üôÇ)üöß   
- [An Operating System Course you can get certificate for](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=94)
- Then move on to practical C programming exercises for OS related topics (POSIX related System programming and IPC programming)!
