# Learning System Programming, Operating System, Concurrent System, and Distributed System
Since I could use some additional practice in C programming, will start with learning C system programming first. Then will move on to Operating System and Concurrent System contents. After that, hoping to cover Distributed System (probably in Golang but we will see).   

Main motivation to cover this materials is to build a stronger foundation in Computer Science...   

### Concepts to cover: 
 1) System Programming (In Progress)   
 2) Concurrent Systems (To be completed)   
 3) Operating Systems (To be completed)   
 4) Distributed Systems (To be completed)   
 5) Parallel Programming (To be completed, stretch goal)


## System Programming
List of things done to learn System Programming (in C):
<br>
- Start with going over lecture notes for [Prof. Anton's System Programming Course](https://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/edu/sysprog21f/)
    - Status: In Progress
- Work on the exerd[Prof. Anton's System Programming Course](https://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/edu/sysprog21f/)
    - Status: In Progress
- Do the Rutgers's Programming Assignments:
    - Status: Not Started
