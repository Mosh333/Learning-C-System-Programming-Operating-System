# Learning System Programming, Operating System, Concurrent System, and Distributed System
Since I could use some additional practice in C programming, will start with learning C system programming first. Then will move on to Operating System and Concurrent System contents. After that, hoping to cover Distributed System (probably in Golang but we will see).

Main motivation to cover this materials is to build a stronger foundation in Computer Science...	

### Concepts to cover: 
 1) System Programming âœ…
 2) Operating Systems âœ…
 3) Concurrent Systems (To be completed)
 4) Distributed Systems (To be completed)
 5) Parallel Programming (To be completed, stretch goal)


## System Programming âœ…
To be done in C/Java
<br>
- Redo CoE 2SH4 Labs âœ…
    - Status: Labs 5/5 complete (includes all bonus questions)
    - Repository [here](./System\ Programming/2SH4_labs/)

## Operating Systems âœ…
To be done in C
<br>
- Redo SoE 3SH3 Labs âœ…
    - Status: Labs 5/5 complete
    - Repository [here](./Operating\ Systems/3SH3_labs/)


## Concurrent Programming
To be done in Python or Golang
Section yet to be ðŸš§

## Distributed Systems
To be done in C or Golang
Section yet to be ðŸš§
- Probably take a primer on Golang then learn more about Distributed Systems

## Parallel Programming
To be done in C
Section yet to be ðŸš§
