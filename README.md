# Improve CS Fundamentals

Main goal is to improve computing fundamentals. Topic to cover are System Programming, Operating System, Concurrent System, and Distributed System.

Main motivation to cover this materials is to build a stronger hands on foundation in Computer Science...	

### Concepts to cover: 
 1) System Programming âœ…
 2) Operating Systems âœ…
 3) Concurrent Systems (To be completed)
 4) Distributed Systems (To be completed)
 5) Parallel Programming (To be completed, stretch goal)


## System Programming âœ…
To be done in C/Java
<br>
- Redo CoE 2SH4 Labs âœ…
    - Status: Labs 5/5 complete (includes all bonus questions)
    - Repository [here](./System%20Programming/2SH4_labs/)

## Operating Systems âœ…
To be done in C
<br>
- Redo SoE 3SH3 Labs âœ…
    - Status: Labs 5/5 complete
    - Repository [here](./Operating%20Systems/3SH3_labs/)


## Concurrent Programming
To be done in Python or Golang
